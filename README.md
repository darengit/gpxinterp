# gpxinterp
#
# I hacked this program to smooth and interpolate spotty strava data
# so that it matches exactly to a strava route
#
# the program is in C++ meant for Linux, essentially a script
# you need Linux and GCC version 5.x, something with C++14 would be safe
# Configurations are set in Config.h, you need to recompile each time you change Config.h
